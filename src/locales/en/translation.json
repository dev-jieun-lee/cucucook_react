    "terms_content": "\n### Article 1 (Purpose)\nThe purpose of this agreement is to define the rights, obligations, and responsibilities of users and the site in using the internet-related services provided by cucucook (hereinafter referred to as 'the site').\n\n### Article 2 (Definitions)\n1. The definitions of terms used in this agreement are as follows:\n   - **Service Contract**: A contract concluded between the site and users regarding the use of services.\n   - **Registration**: The act of filling out the application form provided by the site and completing the service contract by agreeing to these terms.\n   - **Member**: A person who has registered as a member by providing personal information required for membership and can use the site's information and services.\n   - **User Number (ID)**: A combination of letters and numbers determined by the user and approved by the site to identify the user.\n   - **Password (PW)**: A combination of letters and numbers chosen by the user to confirm their identity and protect their personal information.\n   - **Post**: Various files and links posted by a member while using the service, including text, images, and videos.\n   - **Withdrawal (Termination)**: The act of terminating the service or the membership contract.\n\n### Article 3 (Disclosure and Amendment of Terms)\n1. The site shall post the content of these terms, the address, the name of the administrator, the name of the personal information protection officer, and contact information (phone, fax, email, etc.) on the initial service screen of the site for users to know.\n2. The site may amend these terms within the scope that does not violate the law regarding the regulation of terms, the basic law on electronic transactions, the law on electronic signatures, and the law on promotion of information and communication network use and information protection.\n3. If the site amends the terms, it shall specify the effective date and reason for the amendment, and notify users on the initial screen of the site from 7 days before the effective date until the day before the effective date.\n4. Agreeing to these terms means that the user agrees to check for changes to the terms regularly by visiting the site. The site shall not be responsible for any damage caused by the user's failure to know the changed terms.\n5. If a member does not agree to the amended terms, they may request withdrawal (termination), and if they continue to use the services after 7 days from the effective date of the amended terms without expressing their objection, they shall be deemed to have agreed to the amended terms.\n6. Matters not specified in these terms shall be governed by the Telecommunications Basic Act, the Telecommunications Business Act, the Act on Promotion of Information and Communication Network Use and Information Protection, and other relevant laws.\n\n### Article 4 (Establishment of Service Contract)\n1. The service contract is established by the user’s agreement to these terms and the application for use, which is accepted by the site.\n2. The agreement to these terms is expressed by pressing the 'Agree' button on the site at the time of application.\n\n### Article 5 (Membership Registration and Withdrawal)\n1. Membership registration is established by the applicant completing the application form provided by the site.\n2. The site may cancel the registration of members who fall under any of the following cases:\n   - When applying using someone else's name.\n   - When the contents of the application are false or fraudulent.\n   - When applying for purposes that disrupt public order or morals.\n   - When interfering with the use of the site by others or committing acts such as information theft.\n   - When using the site to engage in acts prohibited by law and these terms.\n   - When failing to meet the membership registration requirements set by the site.\n3. The site may suspend the establishment of the service contract until the reason is resolved in the following cases:\n   - When there is insufficient capacity related to the service.\n   - When there are technical difficulties.\n4. The site shall provide all services either through its own development or in collaboration with other organizations and may notify users of changes to the services provided.\n5. Members must promptly inform the site of any changes to the registered information through the member information modification method.\n6. A member may withdraw from the service at any time if they no longer wish to receive the services provided by the site. However, posts that have been re-posted or registered for sharing and notification purposes in bulletin boards, communities, cafes, etc., will not be deleted, so members should delete those before withdrawing.\n\n### Article 6 (User Number Assignment and Changes)\n1. The site assigns user IDs to users according to the provisions of these terms.\n2. User IDs are generally not subject to change; however, if a change is necessary due to unavoidable reasons, the user must terminate their current ID and re-register.\n3. User IDs may be changed at the request of the user in the following cases:\n   - When the user ID is registered as the user's phone number or national ID number, which may infringe privacy.\n   - When the user ID causes discomfort or goes against public morals.\n   - In other reasonable cases.\n4. The management responsibility for the user ID and password rests with the user. The site is not liable for any damages or unauthorized use arising from negligent management of IDs and passwords.\n\n### Article 7 (Consent to Use of Member Information)\n1. Members' information is protected under the 'Personal Information Protection Act' and cucucook's 'Personal Information Processing Policy.'\n2. Only the member may view, modify, or delete their personal information, which is managed solely through their ID and password. Therefore, members should not disclose their ID and password to others and must log out at the end of their session and close the web browser.\n3. When a member applies for service according to these terms, it is regarded as agreeing to the collection and use of personal information recorded in the application form.\n\n### Article 8 (User's Information Security)\n1. Members are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of the information entered from the moment they complete the service registration procedure, and they bear all responsibilities for the consequences of using their ID and password.\n2. The user is responsible for all management related to their ID and password and must report immediately if they discover that their ID or password has been used improperly. All responsibilities resulting from failing to report this lie solely with the member.\n3. Users must accurately log out each time they terminate the use of the site service. The site is not responsible for any losses or damages that may arise from the failure to log out, resulting in unauthorized use of member information.\n\n### Article 9 (Service Availability)\n1. The service availability is based on the principle of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, unless there are special circumstances or technical issues.\n2. Exceptions apply during scheduled maintenance or other necessary downtime as determined by the site.\n\n### Article 10 (Service Interruption and Notification)\n1. The site is not responsible for any losses incurred if messages or other communication data stored or transmitted by the service are lost or deleted due to state emergencies, blackouts, equipment failures, or other force majeure events.\n2. If the site must temporarily suspend service due to difficulties in providing normal service, it will announce the reasons and duration of the suspension before stopping the service, and it will not be responsible if members do not acknowledge the announcements. The site is also not responsible for any losses incurred due to the failure to store or transmit messages and other communication data during service interruptions.\n3. If the site must permanently discontinue service due to its circumstances, it will follow the above provisions.\n4. The site may temporarily modify, change, or suspend the service after prior notice and shall not be liable to members or third parties for such actions.\n5. The site may suspend service without prior notice due to urgent system maintenance, expansions, or replacements and may entirely discontinue current services at its discretion.\n6. The site may limit or suspend all or part of the service if it becomes impossible to provide normal service due to state emergencies, blackouts, equipment failures, or excessive service usage. However, the site will inform users of the reasons and duration either before or after the fact.\n7. The site shall not provide prior notice for interruptions due to causes beyond its control (e.g., unforeseen system failures) and will not notify users of interruptions caused by others’ wrongful acts.\n8. The site may specify separate availability times for different service segments. In this case, it will provide appropriate notice.\n9. The site reserves the right to restrict or suspend service use or terminate the membership contract without the member’s consent if the member violates these terms. In this case, the site may prohibit access for the violating user.\n\n### Article 11 (Information Provision and Advertising Posting)\n1. The site may provide various information to members through posting on the site or by sending emails or postal mail.\n2. The site may post advertisements deemed appropriate for the service and public interest.\n\n### Article 12 (Management and Operation of Site Posts)\n1. The rights to the content of posts made by members belong to the members.\n2. The site reserves the right to edit or move posted content without prior notice and may delete content without prior notice in the following cases:\n   - If it violates the service terms or is deemed illegal, obscene, or vulgar.\n   - If it defames other members or third parties.\n   - If it violates public order and morals.\n   - If it is deemed related to criminal acts.\n   - If it infringes on the rights of third parties, including copyright.\n   - If it violates other relevant laws.\n3. Members are solely responsible for any civil or criminal liabilities arising from the infringement of another’s copyright through their posts.\n\n### Article 13 (Service Usage Restrictions)\n1. The site may suspend the use of the service partially or fully if it finds that the information provided by a member is false or if there are reasonable grounds to suspect falsehood. It shall not be liable for any disadvantages resulting from this.\n2. The site may restrict or suspend service use if a member engages in acts violating these terms, including Article 15 (Member’s Obligations). In this case, the site may prohibit access for the member.\n\n### Article 14 (Obligations of the Site)\n1. The site must not engage in actions prohibited by laws or these terms and must make efforts to continuously and stably provide services.\n2. The site shall not disclose or distribute members' personal information without their consent, except as required by the Personal Information Protection Act.\n3. The site must have a security system to protect users’ personal information (including credit information) to ensure safe use of its services.\n4. The site shall not be liable for service interruptions caused by user negligence.\n\n### Article 15 (Member’s Obligations)\n1. Information required at the time of registration must be entered accurately. Members must also ensure that the information provided remains accurate and up-to-date, and may not allow others to use their ID and password.\n2. Members may not engage in any commercial activities using the service without the site’s prior consent.\n3. Members may not copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, or otherwise use or provide to others any information obtained from the site without prior consent.\n4.
